## How to use this repo / self-lead format

This repo is broken down into 7 sections, each section has a README.md file that will guide you through the self-lead. Each section may have a number of README.md files that will guide you through the section. These are also numbered to help you navigate.

Please do start from the beginning and work your way through the self-lead setup. Starting at 1 and working your way through to 7.

As you work through the self-lead, you will be asked to run various terraform. Please ensure you are in the correct `terraform `directory when running the terraform commands. (You will learn how to do this in section 3 [terraform state](https://github.com/thomast1906/terraform-on-azure/tree/main/3-terraform-state)) - Also remember to destroy your resources when you are done in each section.
